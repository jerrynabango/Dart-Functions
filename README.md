**Dart Functions**

In Dart, functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task and can be reused throughout a program. They are essential for organizing code and making it more manageable. Here's a brief overview of functions in Dart:

1. **addTwo:** This function takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. For example:
   ```dart
   int addTwo(int num1, int num2) {
     return num1 + num2;
   }
   ```

2. **subtractTwo:** This function takes two numbers as arguments and returns their difference. For example:
   ```dart
   int subtractTwo(int num1, int num2) {
     return num1 - num2;
   }
   ```

3. **multiplyTwo:** This function takes two numbers as arguments and returns their product. For example:
   ```dart
   int multiplyTwo(int num1, int num2) {
     return num1 * num2;
   }
   ```

4. **divideTwo:** This function takes two numbers as arguments and returns their quotient. For example:
   ```dart
   double divideTwo(double num1, double num2) {
     return num1 / num2;
   }
   ```

5. **stringLength:** This function takes a string as an argument and returns its length. For example:
   ```dart
   int stringLength(String text) {
     return text.length;
   }
   ```

6. **getFirstElement:** This function takes a list as an argument and returns its first element. For example:
   ```dart
   dynamic getFirstElement(List<dynamic> list) {
     return list.isNotEmpty ? list[0] : null;
   }
   ```

These functions can be called from other parts of the Dart program to perform their respective tasks. Remember to provide appropriate arguments when calling these functions to get the desired results.
